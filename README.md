 ## It's just like in Photoshop. ‚òÅÔ∏è
 Ever wish Fusion had those pesky little buttons that help you align stuff on screen with a single click, just like in Adobe CC apps? 
 
 Well, it does now. üòé
 
 ## How it works üìè
 It's as simple as running the FuAlign comp script, selecting the Merges you want to align or distribute uniformly, and press a button.  It even supports keyboard shortcuts for mouseless operation. ‚å®Ô∏è

## How to install ‚öôÔ∏è
First of all, make sure you have the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your system. üêç

Then, download [this file](https://github.com/brunocbreis/FuAlign/releases/download/v0.2/FuAlign.py) and save it anywhere you'd like. To run the app, just drag it into Fusion any time you're working on a comp.

If you prefer to run it directly from Fusion's or DaVinci Resolve's menu, these are the folders you should save it into:

<details>
<summary><b>ü™ü Windows</b></summary>

DaVinci Resolve: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Comp`

Fusion Studio: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\Fusion Studio\Scripts\Comp`
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üíª MacOS</b></summary>

DaVinci Resolve: `[user]/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Comp`

Fusion Studio: `[user]/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/Fusion Studio/Scripts/Comp`
</details>

Then, from **DaVinci Resolve**, while in the Fusion Page, you can go to `Workspace > Scripts > Comp` and run the *FuAlign* script from there. In **Fusion Studio**, the path is `Scripts > Comp`.
